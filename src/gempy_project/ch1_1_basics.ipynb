    "of stratigraphic deposition, unconformities due to erosion, or other lithological genesis events like igneous intrusions. A similar\n",

    "\n",
    "The correct ordering of series is crucial for model construction! It's possible to assign several surfaces to one series. The order of\n",
    "units within a series only affects the color code, so we recommend maintaining consistency. The order can be defined by simply changing\n",

    "For a model with simple sequential stratigraphy, all layer formations can be assigned to one series without an issue. All unit\n",
